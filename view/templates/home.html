        <p>As machine readable data it will be available for data integration and sharing, including combination with other datasets. </p>
    <p> Data has been sourced from various naming authorities. For inquiries about the actual place-name Gazetteer data please contact the
        relevant naming authority indicated for each placename.</p>
